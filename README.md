# Portfolio




**CAUTION: NO LONGER CONTINUING WITH THIS PROJECT AS IT BECAME TOO CLUMSY AND THE DESIGN WAS OUT OF THE PLACE RIGHT FROM THE START. I AM GOING TO DO ANOTHER ATTEMPT (one could call it portfolio-V2) TO DO A MORE SIMILAR DESIGN THAT ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE.**

My new Portfolio. _Dated 27/10/2023._

It might take several months to complete but it will be done for sure. I will try to my best to actually finish this project and to be as accurate to the design in my mind as possible.

## Plans

1. Design the site!! **_(NOTE: Important)_**
2. Use express and ejs to make it _(code)_ look better.
3. Separate data from the page (use json for data instead of hard coding).
4. Make it responsive.

## Hosting

1. It won't be hosted until it is completely finished
2. After which, I "might" buy a VPS in Hetzner.
3. The domain is going to be: theunconcernedape.me (check out my 3 year old site for now).

## how to use this locally

1. Install node dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. a. Use nodemon to run the server

   ```bash
   nodemon
   ```

   b. Run the server manually

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

3. Site is live at localhost:3000. Open it in your preferred browser.
